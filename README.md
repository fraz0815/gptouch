# gptouch
Basic tool to change screen orientation and its touch input on gnome wayland desktops

# for wayland and cheap touch screens without automatic input change after orientation change
xrandr and xinput are things of the past regarding wayland.
so some basic stuff needs more work.

# uses gnome-ranndr.py which I take no credit for
U can use my fork here https://github.com/fraz0815/gnome-randr
remember where you put it
